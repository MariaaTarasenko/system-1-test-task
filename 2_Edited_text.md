Plans provide clients with a variety of service options defined within a preconfigured score.

Please note: shortly after the feature implementation, your customer service flow and solutions may undergo some alignment. It may happen due to an extensive system update. 
In other words, a user record is now supplemented by additional properties, which are described in the latest version of our API reference. 
For example, users can be transferred to the 'idle' state before they confirm the purchase of a plan.

The capacity of plans per provider is unlimited. 
Feel free to create as many of customized plans as you need. 
Despite that, plans merely reflect well-known user attributes that match completely with the respective state flow.
